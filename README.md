As a graduate student in physics, I found it hard to find a position in the industry that matches my research experience. Another option for me is to find a post-doc position. As we all know, it is very competitive in academia, only part of the postdoc positions will turn into a full-time position at the universities. I want to find the employment data of the graduated PhDs. In our department, only the imminent positions of the past graduated PhDs are listed on our website. Most of the graduated PhD students took a postdoc position. From this limited information, it is hard to get a sense of how hard it will be for the PhD students to get a job. I have seen people working as a postdoc for over ten years. I found that National Science Foundation (NSF) has surveyed thousands of PhDs about their career after graduation.  I want to use the survey data to analyze the career of the PhDs. Hopefully, by looking into the career of the PhDs, I can get some insight on it, which will help the future PhDs. 

Here are the questions I want to answer after this data analysis project:

1. What is the proportion of the postdocs took the postdoc position because of lack of other employment options? How does this proportion correlate with the number of years of being a postdoc (or age)? SOLVED: 1st plot.

Finding: I found that some people got stuck in the postdoc position. Nearly half of the people who are working as a postdoc and also age between 45-50 think they have very little other career options. The number is around 25% for the fresh postdoc of 25 to 30 years old.

2. PhDs in which field work in a different field than their PhD work? SOLVED: 2nd plot

Finding: I found that physical science major has the largest proportion of PhDs that work in a field not so strongly related to their PhD research. It is surprising to see that a lot of engineering majors also work outside of their PhD research. Psychology, health, and computer science majors seem to have a good fit between their research and the job. I have to admit that the difference between fields is much smaller than I expected.

3. In general, is there an over-supply problem of PhDs for the research faculty positions in the US, in terms of the available research positions?

4. The PhD degrees in which fields are the hardest to turn into a related full-time position? I think computer science should be a good field in terms of career opportunities, how about the other fields?

5. What is the trend in the employment of the Doctorate recipients?
